# dice_roller
My first Android application made on my journey to learn Flutter.
It is a very simple dice rolling app, you click the dice images on screen, and they change.

### What I learned by developing this application: 
- How to include assets/images in a Flutter project
- How to detect gesture with Flutter Button Widgets
- How and when to use stateful/stateless widgets in Flutter
